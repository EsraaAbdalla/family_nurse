Because thallium, the physiologic analogue of potassium, focuses on healthy myocardial tissue but not in necrotic or ischemic tissue, areas of the heart with a normal blood supply and intact cells rapidly take it up. Weak blood flow regions and ischemic cells fail to take up the isotope and emerge as cold spots on a scan.This test is usually associated with patients who have had a myocardial infarction or ischemia in order to determine if any areas if their heart muscle\/myocardium are not receiving adequate supply of blood.

According to family members, his recovery course seems to have reached the top.

However, 2 months into work the patient seems to be declining rather than improving, with his performance worsening over the course of several weeks. Colleagues describe him as slowing down, showing poor concentration, and not keeping up with his limited list of tasks. As part of the evaluation, the neurologist orders a routine complete blood count and chemistries, a computed tomography scan, and electroencephalography.

  "OptB": "B. hydrocephalus",

Orbitofrontal contusions may contribute to functional deficits but should not directly contribute to a late decline. Subdural hematoma, hydrocephalus, and hyponatremia should be reasonably well evaluated with the requested diagnostic tests. Depression is a major cause of dysfunction or decline after TBI, and clinicians need to be particularly vigilant for reactive contributions to depression in the context of major life changes that highlight current disability and challenge coping abilities.
